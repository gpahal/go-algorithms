# TODO list

## Algorithms
- More Dynamic Programming examples
- More Greedy Programming examples
- More numerical algorithms ()linear algebra etc.)
- String algorithms (edit distance etc.)
- Image manipulation algorithms (Delaunay triangulation etc.)

## Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.)
- Graphs and related algorithms (probably both adjacency list and matrix
  based)
- Heap
- Hash table (simple implementation - should use map instead of this
  while implementing other algorithms and data structures)
