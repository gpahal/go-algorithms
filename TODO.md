# TODO list

## Algorithms
- More Dynamic Programming examples
- More Greedy Programming examples
- More numerical algorithms (linear algebra etc.)
- String algorithms (edit distance etc.)
- Image manipulation algorithms (Delaunay triangulation etc.)

## Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.)
- Graphs and related algorithms (probably both adjacency list and matrix
  based)
- Heap
- Hash table (simple implementation - should use map instead of this
  while implementing other algorithms and data structures)

## Documentation
- Use GoDoc comments for all structs, interfaces and functions
- Provide examples in the comments
- Comment the various steps used in an algorithm, time complexity, space
  complexity etc.
- List all the data structures and algorithms in the README
